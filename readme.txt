hello sir/ma'am, 
                Please follow the below steps to run this app into your system. I am assuming you have node preinstalled in your system. if not please install node env first.  

Step 1- Setup backend
    => Navigate to the dir named "backend" which is inside the root folder.
    => Open the terminal inside "backend" dir.
    => run command "npm install". This will install all the dependencies into your system.
Step 2- Run the backend server
    => Stay inside the same dir and run the command "npm start"  in the terminal. This will start the Express.JS server at port 9000 

Step 3-Setup frontend
    => from the root dir, Navigate to the client folder.
    => run "npm install" This will install all the dependencies needed
Step 4- Run the frontend server
    => inside the same dir run "npm start" in the terminal. This will start the server on port 3000
Step 5- Test the app
    open your browser and type http://localhost:3000 into your browser. Now you can see the app running.
